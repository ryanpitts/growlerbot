GrowlerBot
==========

A little Python script that scrapes a tap list from the web, compares it to data from the last scrape, and posts any new beers to a Twitter account. Designed to be run as a cron job.

This bot is aimed at the [South Hill Growler Guys](http://www.thegrowlerguys.com/whats-on-tap/washington-spokane-south-hill/') in Spokane, WA. It tweets at [@SoHillGrowlers](https://twitter.com/SoHillGrowlers).
